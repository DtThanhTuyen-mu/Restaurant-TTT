ABOUT PROJECT
-------------
Multitenancy is an architecture that is fairly renowned recently due to the fact that the price of managing softwares aren't affordable for a lot of companies especially those are small restaurants, cafeterias,...
With a multitenant system like us, they'll be able to hire accounts referenced to
their restaurants and use our highly designed features for managing their restaurants' activitites with a more reasonable price;
